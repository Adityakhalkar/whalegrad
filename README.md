** Whalegrad - A Lightweight Deep Learning Framework

Welcome to DeepPy, my personal deep learning framework project. This is a learning journey for me. and i recreate the wheel. (readme file written by me and modified chatgpt :) 

Features:

* Lightweight Framework: DeepPy is a compact deep learning framework built entirely in Python, spanning just under 1000 lines of code. It's designed to be easy to understand and modify.

* Inspired by the Greats: Huge shoutout to Andrej Karpathy's micrograd and tinygrad â€“ they were my muses for diving into this project. Their work inspired me to create something of my own.

* Multi-Dimensional Array Support: Just like Whalor, DeepPy supports multi-dimensional arrays. Whether you're working with float, int, numpy arrays, or lists, DeepPy has got you covered.

* Automatic Gradient Computation: Say goodbye to manual gradient calculations! DeepPy comes with built-in support for automatic gradient computation, making your life a whole lot easier.

* Rich Activation Functions: Spice up your neural networks with a variety of activation functions. DeepPy boasts a collection of activation functions to suit your model's needs.

* Diverse Loss Functions: No one-size-fits-all here! DeepPy offers a range of different loss functions, allowing you to fine-tune your model for optimal performance.

# Whalegrad

* it is deep learning framework 
* it is learninig project for me 
* It is supports multi-dim array like  Whalor.
* It support float, int numpy-array and list.
* it supports auto grad
* completely in python under ~1000 lines of code
* andrej karapthy's micorgrad and tiny grad inspire me to build the this project 
* it has lots of aactivation functions , different different loss fucntions 



# TODO:
1. intro - LOC, python, learning project, inspiration tiny and micorgrad
2. example : basic auto grad and nn example 
3. functionality : autograd, activation fn, RNN, CNN and transformers
4. future scope
